Hi, I’m @JeshSpaghetti, my friends call me Jesh.
I’m interested in coding and expanding my knowledge on the subject.
I’m currently learning how to become a software engineer, but my real goal is to become a video game designer. 
I’m looking to collaborate on any simple projects that help you and I grow to become more competent coders.
You can reach me at jecervantes15@gmail.com for any sorts of questions! Hope you have a great day!
